# BSc Final Project - IoT Wildlife and Intrusion Detection System - Arduino Components

[Project Overview Image: Optional]

## Introduction

Welcome to the Arduino Components repository for the IoT Wildlife and Intrusion Detection System. This repository contains the Arduino code and related resources for the hardware components used in the project. These components play a crucial role in detecting motion, capturing images, measuring temperature, and providing alerts.

## Features

- **ESP32-Cam Motion Detection**: The ESP32-Cam device, equipped with a PIR sensor, captures images when motion is detected and uploads them to the main controller.

- **ESP8266 Indoor Sensors and Alerts**: ESP8266 controllers serve as indoor sensors measuring temperature and humidity, and trigger visual and audible alerts when alarms are raised.

- **Communication via MQTT and REST**: The components communicate seamlessly with the main controller using MQTT for real-time updates and REST for initial setup.

- **Modular Design**: The code is modular and well-organized, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the respective `.ino` files for the ESP32-Cam and ESP8266 devices.

3. Install the necessary libraries as mentioned in the code comments.

4. Customize the settings in the code as per your requirements, including WiFi credentials, MQTT broker details, and device-specific configurations.

5. Upload the code to your devices and monitor the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor for debugging information.
